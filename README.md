## 📌 Business Chosen
**Habibs Hair & Beauty – Bangalore**  
A luxury hair and beauty salon offering haircuts, styling, coloring, smoothening, skin treatments, bridal makeup, and grooming services.

## 📌 Prompt Logic & System Design

The prompt system works with:
1. **Master System Prompt**  
   Defines tone, structure, SEO rules, CTAs, voice, and page requirements.

2. **Stepwise User Prompts**  
   Commands used to generate homepage, services, gallery, pricing, testimonials, and contact pages.

   All generated content is exported into structured Markdown files.

This mirrors a real-world AI-driven content pipeline.
